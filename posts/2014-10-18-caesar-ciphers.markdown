Welcome to the eleventh edition of Elixir Quiz. This week we will be encrypting a piece of text using a simple Caesar Cipher.

### What is a Caesar Cipher

The [Caesar Cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) is one of the simplest encryption methods.

It is named after the famous [Roman general and statesman Julius Caesar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar). Caesar used the technique in his reign as Roman general, in which he used a cipher with a left-shift of 3 to hide the contents of his military messages.

Another famous Caesar Cipher is known as [ROT13](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13), in which the text is shifted by 13 characters. This was popular in the early days of the internet, to hide spoilers on [Usenet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) forums.

The cipher is extremely insecure, as it is susceptible to [frequency analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis) attacks.

### The problem

> Create a function that takes a piece of plain text (either in a string, or as a path to a file), as well as a number, and performs a shift of that many places on the text.

> As a stretch goal, see if you can reduce the time taken to encrypt large pieces of text by encrypting sections of it in parallel.

### How do I enter?

The Caesar Cipher quiz runs from Saturday October 18th 2014 until Friday October 24th, 2014.

To enter, just complete the problem and post the code to [our subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz). As always, you can host your code anywhere (like [Github Gists](https://gist.github.com/)), or post your solution directly into the subreddit post.

### Example solutions

After the quiz period ends on October 24th, I will update this section and talk about some interesting solutions that were posted to [our subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz)
