Welcome to the twelveth edition of Elixir Quiz. This week we will be generating a tournament schedule for a set of teams.

### What is a Caesar Cipher



### The problem

> Given a list of unique team names, generate a tournament schedule with the following rules

* Each team must play each other twice. Given 4 teams, each team would play 6 matches (2 matches against the other 3 teams) and there would be 12 matches in total
* If there are an odd number of teams, one team must be given a 'bye' each round.
* No team may play against a team for a second time until it has played all other teams at least once.

### How do I enter?

The Caesar Cipher quiz runs from Saturday October 18th 2014 until Friday October 24th, 2014.

To enter, just complete the problem and post the code to [our subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz). As always, you can host your code anywhere (like [Github Gists](https://gist.github.com/)), or post your solution directly into the subreddit post.

### Example solutions

After the quiz period ends on October 24th, I will update this section and talk about some interesting solutions that were posted to [our subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz)
